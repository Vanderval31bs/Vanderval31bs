## About Me

I hold a bachelor's degree in Mathematics from UFSC and am currently pursuing a postgraduate degree in Data Science and Analytics at USP. With nearly 5 years of experience in scientific and web software development. I have strong knowledge in SQL, Python, machine learning frameworks, statistics, and models.

## Projects

### [Cardiovascular Disease Prediction](link_github)
A comprehensive end-to-end project based on a dataset to predict the presence of cardiovascular diseases using machine learning. It includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with statistical tests, clustering, perceptual map construction, development of an application, and APIs using Flask. The project utilizes Python with libraries like Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, among others. The final model selected was XGBoost, chosen after comparison with other models and fine-tuned using grid search with cross-validation.

### [Data Science Salaries EDA](link_github)
An exploratory analysis project investigating how factors such as company size, seniority, location, and others influence salaries in the data field. The project is developed in a Python notebook and utilizes libraries for data manipulation and visualization, such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

### [A hierarquia causal de espa√ßos-tempos](https://repositorio.ufsc.br/handle/123456789/244209)
Bachelor's thesis in Mathematics. It consists of a general review of Lorentz geometry and spacetimes, aiming to classify them according to their causal properties through the causal hierarchy. This work falls under the area of Mathematical Physics, specifically General Relativity, and has a strong focus on geometry.

### [Employee Attrition Analysis](link_github)
Final project for the Machine Learning course at UFSC, aimed at modeling the probability of an employee leaving the company and identifying which variables are important to reduce turnover. Python programming language and libraries such as Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib were used for exploratory analysis and the creation of the predictive model.
